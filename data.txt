Welcome to the EuroChem brand guidelines.

As a global business, it is vital that we maintain a consistent identity
that reflects our position as one of the world’s leading mineral
fertilizer producers.
Maintaining this consistency is critical, and relies on us ensuring that
the EuroChem brand is implemented correctly wherever it’s used.
A consistent brand experience means that we not only look the same
each time the brand appears but that we also stay true to our core
purpose and values. It is these ideas at the heart of our brand
that make EuroChem truly unique and support our company’s strong
sense of direction and purpose.

Using the guidelines
This guide explains all the elements of the EuroChem visual
identity and details how to use them to create our ‘look and feel’
in a consistent and relevant way.

This is a living document and it is subject to regular
updates.

Whether you’re creating a brochure or producing a PowerPoint
presentation, these guidelines will assist you in designing and
producing coherent and compelling communications that will
truly engage and inspire our audiences.
It is very important that this branding is applied accurately and
consistently, and therefore that these guidelines are followed
whenever the brand is implemented.
Please take the time to understand how they work,
and how all our elements can be used together.

This symbol marks links to useful resources,
sections of the document, or contacts.

Checklist for controlling created materials.

All EuroChem-branded entities have to follow this guide
when creating brand materials and applications.

Checklist
To maintain a consistent
brand image, it is crucial that all
communications and materials
comply with the brand style
described in this guide.
Before approving and producing
layouts, check them against
the following checklist:

Deviations from the rules
described in this guide are
allowed only with the approval
of the Brand Team.

contents

Logo

Graphic language

Make sure that the latest version of the logo
is used, following the rules described.
It is prohibited to use logo variations not presented
in this guide.

Use only approved graphic elements when
designing layouts: Directional pattern and / or
Horizon and Stripe. Introduction of new elements is
only allowed with the approval of the Brand Team.

Colour palette

Icons and pictograms

Check the colours used in the layout —
they should correspond to the corporate colour
palette. Introduction of new colours is only allowed
with the approval of the Brand Team.

Only use branded icons and pictograms.
Make sure that they are used sparingly,
neatly, and match the topic.

Fonts

Photographs

Only use the Proxima Nova font family with
four styles: Light, Regular, Semibold, and Bold.
Arial is acceptable for electronic media.

Make sure that the photographs used in the layout
correspond to the corporate style and are
professionally done with sufficient quality.

Overall impression
Make sure that the layout does not contain elements that do not match the brand style, particularly
with regards to branded graphics and colour palettes. Only when all brand elements work together,
and there are no foreign solutions and techniques, will the overall impression match the company image.

2.1

Symbol rationale
In EuroChem, we improve the quality of life of
the growing world population. Our products are
at the core of many fundamental industries —
from fertilizer and feed products used in food
production, to industrial chemicals for health
and safety, to iron ore for steelmaking.
This is reflected at the heart of our symbol —
a molecule, an ore pellet, a fertilizer granule —
the foundation for growth and expansion.

Corporate brand guidelines. Refer here for additional materials and support

We work beneath the soil, and we work with the soil.
We help crops and whole industries to grow, and we
grow ourselves. We respect the past and strive for
the future. That’s why our symbol expands outwardly.
We are present North, West, South and East,
available every season, and equally effective
across markets. That’s why our symbol has four parts.
We continuously process resources into growth,
we process knowledge into solutions.
That’s why our symbol illustrates movement.

2.2 Main logo
Overview
Our logo is an important part of the visual expression of our brand.
It must be used correctly to ensure our company is represented
consistently across all communications.
Horizontal logo (primary logo)

Centred logo

The EuroChem primary logo is horizontal
which consists of the EuroChem Name and
the EuroChem Symbol.

In certain applications, for example narrow formats,
it might be difficult to fit the horizontal version,
in which case the centred version can be applied.

Full logo suite in all formats, including vector,
is available here.

The majority of EuroChem applications should
use this logo if possible.

Our logo must be clearly visible and reproduced
consistently. For this reason, the absolute minimum
size has been established and shown above.
The logo does not have a maximum reproduction size.

The logo is protected by the clear space which ensures
that it has maximum impact and visibility across
all communications. The clear space is measured
by the ‘E’ taken from the logo as illustrated above.
Please observe this rule and ensure that no other
graphic elements intrude into the clear space.
The preferred position of our logo is top-left or
bottom-right.
For some applications it may not be possible to place
the logo top-left or bottom-right — in these instances
one of other corners is permissible.

Font Weight: Proxima Nova Light и Bold
Font Size: will vary depending on application
Font Colour: corporate blue, white for reversing out.
The internal colours when talking about divisions,
however use internal colours sparingly

This is the type format for introductory copy that
directly follows a main heading. Set in 80 % Black
or EuroChem Blue.

Font Weight: Proxima Nova Regular
Font Size: will vary depending on application
Font Colour: 80 % Black or Corporate blue

Sub heading style A, this is the first sub-heading style,
set in EuroChem Blue for Group communications.
Can also be set in one of the Internal colours for divisional communications.

Font Weight: Proxima Nova Semi-Bold
Font Size: 9 pt over 11 pt leading
Font Colour: Corporate blue or Secondary corporate colour

Sub-heading type B, this is the second sub-heading style.
Please note: If further sub-heading styles are needed use your judgement on colour and font weight.

Font Weight: Proxima Nova Semi-Bold
Font Size: 8pt over 10pt leading
Font Colour: 80 % Black

Body copy is generally set in Proxima Nova Light or Regular 8.5 pt over 10.5 leading.
When increasing the Body copy size, e.g. for large format applications —
please make the leading 2 points larger than the point size of the copy,
for example 18 pt over 20 pt leading or 72 pt over 74 point leading.

Font Weight: Proxima Nova light или Regular
Font Size: 8.5 pt over 10.5 pt leading
Font Colour: 80 % Black

When determining type hierarchy in your layouts,
the type styles shown above are for guidance.
These cover the common hierarchy types, however,
there may be exceptions to the rule.
These text styles are included by default
in all corporate document templates available
on our intranet.

Main headings

Sub headings

Should always be largest in size, with clear spacing.
We tend to keep headings in a Light weight with
perhaps a pull-out word.

Help define key copy segments. Small pops of colour
help to define sub-headings, do not overuse any
of the divisional colours in typography

Introductory copy directly follows a main heading,
and is before any body copy or sub-headings.

Please note: When using the Arial font — the same
hierarchy rules apply.

The benefits

Cut-out images

Photography is an important tool that is used to support
the new style of the company. The goal is to show
EuroChem as a modern, progressive, and responsible
fertilizer manufacturer that plays a leading role
in the market.

Images without a background ("cut-outs") help
to emphasize our focus on the end result of fertilizers:
high-quality crops and yields. They often complement
rectangular narrative images, especially customer and
benefit photos.

They should not be overused and dominate in layouts,
but are a good addition, for example, placed on top
of the directional pattern.

We use both narrative photographs and cut-out.

6.2 The EuroChem grid
Overview
All elements of our graphic language are aligned to an invisible grid
which helps us to create consistent compositions and layouts.
It is a combination of horizontal and isometric grids.
The horizon, stripe and the directional pattern all align to this grid.

Horizontal grid

Isometric grid

+
The EuroChem grid allows you to accurately place
the horizon, stripe and directional pattern elements.
We have created a master Adobe Illustrator file
of the grid that you can place in your layout
to allow the horizon, stripe and directional pattern
to be constructed consistently and therefore
standardised across all collateral.

For most standard applications we have developed
a grid based on standard landscape and portrait A-size
formats, such as A3, A4, A5 and DL. The EuroChem grid
can easily be scaled into these formats, as explained
on the following pages.

We have set some key sizes for the height of the stripe
which will work in most standard applications.
Please note: for print applications do not make the stripe
any narrower than 3 mm.

do not separate it.

However on some applications, e.g. above, the stripe
is used on its own and it may bleed off the edge.

For non standard sizes, e.g. when you have
a wide horizon and stripe, like on our website
footer, we recommend scaling the stripe roughly
to the proportions above, it should never look
too thick in proportion.

When using a cut-out image on your layout,
the stripe should always go behind it.

When using the horizon together with the stripe,
e.g. in our PowerPoint template above, the stripe
should always be coloured in one of our secondary

Directional pattern
Directional pattern rationale
The visual language is derived from the stylised rhombus of the logo.
The rhombus is abstracted to form four triangles. These triangles are used
as the basis for an isometric grid on which the graphic is constructed.
The triangles appear as forward-facing arrows.
They are used as a secondary graphic element and are never over-powering.

6.4

Create your pattern by drawing a square, rotating it
45 degrees and deleting the left anchor point to leave
you with a triangle pointing forwards, always ensure
the square you start with has equal sides.

Build up your pattern using these triangles, align
to The EuroChem grid as a guide to form a directional
pattern. We have some ready-made patterns for you
to use in landscape and portrait formats as a guide.
Ready-made patterns

Opacity 100 %

Once you’re happy with your composition create
a compound path by selecting all of the triangles
then go to Object > Path > Make Compound Path.
Please ensure the triangles are equilateral and are
aligning exactly at the points where they touch.

Opacity 0 %

When triangles are applied on white backgrounds
colour it in EuroChem Blue gradient with Opacity
changing from 0 % to 100 %, angle -45° setting.
This will create a gradient that runs through the entire
pattern rather than each triangle individually.

contents

Finally apply a 7 % opacity to the whole pattern
when applied to white backgrounds, this completes
the subtle effect we are looking for.
The gradient always needs to smoothly run through
the entire pattern, no matter how large or small an area
it covers.

Corporate brand guidelines. Refer here for additional materials and support

When applying the directional pattern
to EuroChem Blue or one of the divisional colours,
the pattern is coloured in white (Opacity changing
from 0 % to 100 %) with a 7 % opacity to whole pattern.
Some colours e.g. yellow and green may require
a stronger opacity, for example 10–12 %.

7 % opacity

The directional pattern can be applied
to EuroChem Blue, in this case the pattern
is coloured in white with a 7 % opacity.

The directional pattern can be applied to one
of our secondary colours, in this case the pattern
is coloured in white. Adjust the opacity according
to the colour to give a gentle effect.

The pattern may be applied to the horizon area
but should not cross onto the stripe or the white area
of your layout.

The directional pattern can also be applied
over an image, in which case it should have
enough contrast for the pattern to be visible,
adjust the opacity. Colour the triangles
in EuroChem Blue over a light-toned image.

Conversely, please apply the pattern in white over
a darker-toned image, you may need to adjust
the opacity according to the image to provide
the subtle overlay we are looking for.

The pattern may be applied to the horizon or

are aligned to the EuroChem grid.

When creating directional patterns for most
standard formats, limit the triangle sizes
to no more than 3 in a single pattern. You may
have more than one of a particular size though.

Patterns may bleed off the left hand edge
but should never cut through a triangle
on the right hand side.

Directional patterns have a strong sense of going
forwards — left-to-right, starting with a large
triangle on the left and fading out with smaller ones
on the right — never reverse this arrangement.

Patterns are always isometric, never create mirror
images in your patterns or anything that resembles
the EuroChem logo.

Do not create overly-complicated directional
patterns, with too many triangles of the same size.

Do not colour the directional pattern
in one of the secondary colours,
even when using it on top of EuroChem Blue.

How will we get there?
Our strategy is to maintain sustainable growth through cost leadership
and innovation. To achieve our vision, we have set ourselves some
specific targets. We will:
• Become the company with the best
occupational and process safety
performance in the chemical industry
measured as Total Recordable Incidents
(TRI) and Loss of Primary Containment
(LOPC) rates.
• Increase our risk-adjusted profitability
to the highest level in the industry
with returns equal to or exceeding
both the cost of capital and the
industry average.
• Become a customer-centric company,
measured as a 60 % increase in the net
promoter score from 31 % to 50 %.
• Ensure world-class compliance and risk
management throughout EuroChem,
measured by achieving top-quartile
ranking by international auditors.

Do not allow the directional pattern to touch
or cross the EuroChem logo.

Do not allow the directional pattern to cross over
people’s faces.

• Strengthen the way we select and
construct capital projects in order to
achieve higher risk-adjusted net present
value (NPV) across the portfolio from
minor modifications to large greenfield
projects, ensuring these are approved
on realistic and conservative parameters
and stay within these parameters
through their execution.
• Become a high-performing, international
learning organisation by providing
purpose, building employee capabilities,
developing fulfilling career paths and
succession programmes establishment
of a culture that provides for clear
direction setting, role-modelling
leadership, continuous improvement,
empowerment of the front line, caring
meritocracy, reduction of bureaucracy
and enjoyable work — measured as both
an increase in employee engagement
of 15 percentage points from 50 % to
65 % and a 10 % overall improvement
in employee attitude via a corporate
diagnostic survey.

Do not create overly complicated directional
patterns behind text and images.

EuroChem is developing a strong culture
of continuous improvement throughout the
business. We’re curious about what – and
how – we can improve every day. We’re
eager to share what we know within our
teams – and always keen to learn from
colleagues in other locations. Naturally
we’re interested in what our competitors
are doing, but we also look further afield
to other industries for best practice ideas
and inspiration that we can adapt to
enhance our own operations.

To drive excellence and continuous improvement
across the business, we created a unique way of
operating: the EuroChem Business System. This
is a systematic way of working for all our functions
and production units, that helps us become safer,
more productive and more profitable – as well as
keeping us one step ahead of the competition.

1. To ensure that production keeps
running, by assuring a steady offtake
of own-produced products (OPP).

2. To make short and medium-term
commercial optimisation decisions.
These include the timing and tenor of
transactions – and the choice of wholesale
or retail channels, depending on where the
highest value can be achieved. For example,
some products are sold via distributors,
where circumstances dictate that it would be
uneconomic for EuroChem to operate in those
markets. The Company buys from – and sells
to – traders and competitors when and where
it makes good business sense to do so.

Production is the most valuable part of
EuroChem. The Company makes its money
in its plants; the Commercial Division is the
essential service provider that gets products
to market and ensures that the upstream
margin is realised. The CD also provides
crucial additional liquidity that might not
be available if EuroChem relied exclusively
on FOB sales – securing the substantial
production margin and an additional riskadjusted net margin.

3. To provide commercial input on
investment decisions.
This occurs at both Group and Divisional
levels, by providing feedback from the
market on demand trends, customer decision
criteria and competitor behaviour. For
example, the Commercial Division can make
recommendations on the optimum size and
location for a new warehouse or how many
additional railcars the Group should buy
or lease. The CD also actively participates
in cross-divisional work, such as with the
Ferilizer Division as part of the New Product
Development (NPD) process and the Mining
Division with its iron ore-upgrading program.

COMMERCIAL DIVISION

The CD works to expand EuroChem’s logistics
cost advantage, through scale and making
optimal choices. For example, loading large
ships out of its own ports – ideally with single
loading or discharge stops – delivers significant
cost advantages and is one of the Company’s
biggest levers.

COMMERCIAL DIVISION

To ensure EuroChem sells into the best
markets, to the best customers – through
the best part of the chain, the CD’s
simulation tool shows how much cost is
involved from the product’s origin through
the entire chain to its destination – and
considers all the logistics options.
The CD is upgrading its market research,
data analytics, inventory valuation,
planning consistency and quality, and
automation. Commercial and logistics are
co-located in Zug to facilitate cooperation
and exchange of information.

Over the course of a working day, EuroChem
employees send some 65,000 emails, including
9,000 to external recipients, such as partners
and customers. The efficiency of such communication
plays an important role in EuroChem’s overall business
success.
The quality of our emails not only affects our daily
performance, it also shapes our image,
be it as individual contributors or as a group.
A recipient should receive a sense of uniformity when
corresponding with individuals from the EuroChem
team, wherever they may be based. This includes
the font, size and colour as well as any logo.
Certain regions require mandatory information
to be included in email communication, but wherever
you are, emails should always be treated as business
letters. The Group’s global approach to signatures

The reception creates the visitor's first impression,

Use live plants as an accent. A ready-made solution
could be a planter partition.

10.2 Basic principles

Think beyond design

Focus on value

Take care of visitors

Adhere to standards

Our main goal is to develop
the EuroChem brand as the supplier
of choice and as a great partner and
employer. A beautiful facade or interior
have a huge impact, but will have little
value if our service is poor or if there is
nowhere to park.
Keep this in mind at all times.

When you plan to design something,
ask yourself:
"Will this design be useful,
will it add value?".
If the answer is "no", then most likely
it is not worth wasting resources.
In most cases, it makes sense to design
only objects and parts of territories
through which a large traffic of visitors
passes.

If the budget allows, you can do
landscaping. Landscaping is a complex
of measures: organization of walking
routes, access roads and parking lots,
installation of drains, stairs.
This includes lighting and greening,
recreation areas and smoking areas,
small architectural forms: gazebos,
canopies, etc.

When preparing a design project,
you should study all relevant official
standards and comply with them.
So, for example, in Russia there is
GOST 12.4.026-2015, which defines
the requirements for safety signs and
signal markings, and its requirements
must be taken into account.

10.3 Facades
General principle

Main graphic principle for facades follows the general
corporate identity rules described earlier.
The lower part of the facade is painted
in EuroChem blue, the upper part is white, or light
gray / silver metallic for industrial buildings and technical
facilities. The two colour areas are separated by a blue
stripe, its height is 5 %* of the height of the blue part.
Individual elements of structures (ramps, railings,
stairs, etc.) can also be painted in corporate colours,
as long as it does not contradict the requirements of
regulations and safety. Technical structures, outdoor
stairs, and roof slopes should be painted in dark gray.
This approach should be applied only to key objects
of the territory with the maximum traffic of visitors,
other buildings and structures can be painted in
the single colour.

* 5 % — the recommended height, it can be selected locally, based
on the realities. To simplify the painting or installation of cladding,
the strip should be placed above the window and door openings
of the first floor.

11.1

Stands: general principle
Complex stands always rely on a simple "box" principle —
an external corporate shell that is uniform for all events, filled
with specific content (for example, product presentation).
This principle simplifies the process of developing exhibition
spaces (no need to invent every time) and ensures
the integrity of the brand image.

11.2 Mobile constructions
For small or recurring events, lightweight mobile constructions such as roll-ups
and various stands can be used.
The specific models and contents of such structures can vary widely depending on
the event's tasks, budget, and technical capabilities.
The main advantage of mobile structures is their ability to be reused, so when
choosing such solutions, situational content (such as the names of specific events
or frequently changing business indicators) should be avoided.

Contact the Brand Team for support
with exhibitions.

Corporate brand guidelines. Refer here for additional materials and support

95

Exhibitions

11.3 Field events
Tents are the main element for field events.
Specific models and content of tents can vary widely,
depending on the objectives of the event, budget and
technical capabilities.
Classical or arched pavilions are recommended.
The design uses a principle similar to conventional
stands — corporate exterior and thematic content.
White tents are preferred as they absorb less heat
but an option in a corporate dark blue colour is also
possible (for example, when it is known in advance
that all neighbors will have white tents).

The size and location of the logo depend on
the specific construction and are determined based
on the following principles:
• Minimum distortion due to fabric folds.
• Good visibility from a distance.
• Not be more than one logo on one surface.
If necessary, the design of the tent can be
supplemented with additional communication
(for example, a slogan or a website address).
Tents can be supplemented with flags.

Знаки продуктовых линеек

Схема построения знаков регулярной продуктовой линейки

Знаки продуктов, не имеющих собственной идентификации,
строятся на основе единой модульной сетки, показанной
на рисунке.

1⁄3

В некоторых случаях для достижения большей гармоничности знака допустимо отступать от заданной модульной
сетки, сохраняя при этом общий принцип построения знака.

Special programs and events

14.1

Overview
Sometimes we might need to brand and create specific visuals
to raise awareness around special programmes and / or communication
campaigns.
As a rule, for special programs, a small add-on to the current corporate
identity is sufficient, as shown in the examples below:
Basic event logos module

Unique event sign (optional)

Anniversaries of enterprises

YEARS
SUBSIDIARY

The corporate style of EuroChem is preserved:
EuroChem Blue colour, corporate font.

Logo modules were developed for
events / programmes under the aegis of EuroChem.

For the anniversaries of enterprises, a special solution
is provided, which is presented below.

On the right side of the plate there is a graphic
image / symbol of the event, place, or event idea.

This scheme allows you to create a unique visual event
representation, while remaining within the corporate
style.

If you have questions about these examples
or need another solution, please reach out
to the Brand Team.
